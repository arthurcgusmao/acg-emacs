;;; Commentary:

;; Define `sensitive-minor-mode' to disables backup and auto-save files (based on code from
;; `http://anirudhs.chaosnet.org/blog/2005.01.21.html').

;;; Code:

(defvar sensitive-minor-mode nil
  "Sensitive file minor mode.")

;;;###autoload
(define-minor-mode sensitive-minor-mode
  "For sensitive files like password lists.
Disables backup creation and auto saving in the current buffer.

With no argument toggles the mode. Non-null prefix argument turn on the mode,
null prefix argument turn off the mode."
  :global nil
  (if (symbol-value sensitive-minor-mode)
      (progn
        ;; disable backups
        (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t)
        ;; disable auto-save
        (if auto-save-default
            (auto-save-mode -1)))
    ;; resort to default value of backup-inhibited
    (kill-local-variable 'backup-inhibited)
