# Overview

This is my personal Emacs configuration repo. All my Emacs configs are here, such as keybindings, UI configurations, custom functions, installation and definitions of packages, etc. More can be found in the [README](./README.md).

# Straight

I use `straight` together with `use-package` to install and configure packages.
That means that the source code of dependencies and packages can be found in `./straight/repos/` - you can leverage it to see how a package is implemented when addressing requests or questions.
