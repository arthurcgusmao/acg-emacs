* My personal notes on Emacs packages and related

** Emacs Jupyter

- Save image by `M-x image-save` when image under point [ref: https://github.com/dzop/emacs-jupyter/issues/149];


** Magit

*** Commit Fixup (command `cF` -- `magit-commit-fixup`)
Add staged changes to a commit different than the last one.

*** Commit Reword (command `cw` -- `magit-commit-reword`)
Modify the last commit's message.

** Handle Git conflicts
*** Smerge mode
Type =C-c ^ C-h= to enter the help buffer.
The usual commands are:
- =C-c ^ u= for upper commit
- =C-c ^ l= for lower commit
- =C-c ^ a= for all (both) commit

*** Ediff
Ediff shows in multiple windows:
- Version A
- Version B
- Result preview after you resolve conflicts
- The common ancestor of both versions
